# Peerly Presentation Script (Subtle Version)
**Duration:** ~1 minute 30 seconds

**(0:00 - 0:15) [Intro]**
"Managing money between friends can sometimes be a bit undefined. We often lend small amounts for things like lunch or tickets, but without a clear record, it’s easy for things to slip through the cracks. We built **Peerly** to simply provide that clarity—a way to keep track of shared finances without making it feel like a business transaction."

**(0:15 - 0:45) [The Core: Simple Lending]**
"The core of the app is designed to be as frictionless as possible. When you need to send or request money, you just enter the amount. You have the option to add interest if you want, but it's flexible. 
Peerly handles the math for you, showing a clear breakdown. You can send this request to a friend within the app, or if they aren't on Peerly yet, just generate a **link** and send it via text. Once confirmed, you both get a simple digital receipt. It’s not about enforcing a contract; it’s just about having a shared record so everyone is on the same page."

**(0:45 - 1:05) [Trust & Connections]**
"We also wanted to add a layer of transparency to these interactions. The **Social Trust Score** is a subtle indicator of reliability based on successful repayments. It helps you understand your network's habits over time. In the Friends tab, you can manage these connections easily, keeping your social financial circle organized."

**(1:05 - 1:20) [Dashboard & Context]**
"On the Home screen, everything is visible at a glance—your current balance and any pending requests. We’ve also included a market watchlist for those interested in the broader financial picture, letting you keep an eye on trends right alongside your personal transactions."

**(1:20 - 1:30) [Outro]**
"Peerly is really just about removing the ambiguity from lending and borrowing. It keeps things clear, simple, and friendly. Thank you."
